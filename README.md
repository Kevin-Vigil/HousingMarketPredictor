## 1.2.0

The current status on this project is ongoing.

#### How to use (Current 1.2.0)
The program currently operates as a CSV parsing component

- Download repo
- Update the mapper to whatever columns you want to seperate into a CSV
- Create an ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook) and use your data for ML!
- Enjoy :)

> Opening file will process the CSV using the mapper, giving a cleaned up CSV. By entering a key and then choosing "Split CSV", you can split the CSV into multiple CSVs based on the column key given. 

### Updates
- Created ipynb file that is able to run ML models on data.
- Showed use of some files in said ipynb file, with inclusion of a CSV file in src as an example use.
